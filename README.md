# GameEngine
This code is meant to be further built upon by whomever would want to use it, and already have the following systems  
implemented by this engine:  
- Inventory
- Combat
- Map
- Currency
- Loot generation based on context  

<br/>(5/20)The code provided here is not the final code that myself nor my group had completed. We had a functional
engine that could be further built off of. This code was built around December 2017 as a final project for my Data Structures class.
Neither my group members nor myself were familiar with version control systems, thus none of us any longer have the completed source code.
I plan to eventually rework this code to where it was, if not further. I will be adding updates as I feel necessary.
